    <p>alaska The website is very clear and the tabs and drop downs are bold. It makes navigation very easy and is a very friendly interface. It has a calendar as well as a variety of ways to contact them. The first page has a nice picture which is welcoming. The search bar is in the top right corner which I like. </p>

    <p>Iowa The interface is a little too zoomed in for my liking. However the drop down menus are bold and in the top middle of the screen. Important people are present on the top of the website. The search bar is large and has a moving message repeating on the screen. I like how the main tabs are arraigned with different colors.</p>



    <p>oklahoma The interface is welcoming and has a slide show of pictures moving across the screen. The colors are vibrant and enjoyable to look at. It doesn't have navigation links on the top of the screen. However it does have a search bar in the top right corners similar to the first two websites. All of the tabs have pictures that convey the message of each tab.

    <p>Tennessee First look is good it has a slideshow in the top middle. It also has drop down menus on the top of the screen with arrows indicating there are more menus under each tab. The menus below have welcoming pictures associated with the name of each menu. It has social media links as well as a calendar on the bottom. </p>

    <p> Vermont The first website without a search bar. There is also no long line of tabs on the top middle of the screen. It glows green when you put the curser over the images they glow green which is interesting. It has important people near the bottom of the website. It has support and contact at the very bottom of the page.
